# INFINITE STUDIO: ARIA PLATINUM (A53 EDITION)

## Launch Sequence
1. **Unmute your phone.**
2. **Type your Mission** (e.g., "Aria exploring the ruins").
3. **TAP "INITIATE STREAM".**
4. **Wait 3-5 Seconds.** The text in the box will change to "WRITING SCENE...".
5. The first image will load. The glitch will trigger. Audio will fade in.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Sound?** Tap the screen once while the movie plays. Android blocks audio until you interact.
- **Still Frozen?** Refresh. The new "Watchdog" code prevents it from getting stuck on loading forever.
- **Recording:** Use your phone's built-in Screen Recorder (Media Sounds).

**Titanium & Glass. Forever Ascending.**
