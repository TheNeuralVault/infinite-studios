# INFINITE STUDIO: ARIA PLATINUM EDITION
**State-of-the-Art Generative Stream Protocol**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LAUNCH INSTRUCTIONS (MOBILE)
**READ FIRST:** Modern browsers (Chrome/Safari) block AI Audio and Auto-Play video by default. You must perform the "Handshake."

### 1. The Audio Unlock
- **Turn your Phone Volume UP.** (Media Volume).
- If your phone is on **Silent/Vibrate Mode**, the AI voice may be muted by the OS. **Turn off Silent Mode.**
- **Headphones Recommended:** The procedural soundtrack generates low-frequency bass that phone speakers cannot always reproduce.

### 2. The Ignition Sequence
1. **Tap the Input Box.**
2. **Type your Mission.** (e.g., *Aria hacking the mainframe in zero gravity*).
3. **TAP THE "INITIATE PLATINUM STREAM" BUTTON FIRMLY.**
   - **WAIT 10 SECONDS.** 
   - *Why?* The system is initializing the Neural Voice, generating the Soundtrack buffer, and fetching the first 4K image from the cloud. The screen will remain black or static for these 10 seconds. This is normal.

### 3. The Broadcast Loop
Once the first image appears:
- **Do not refresh.** The system runs on a "First-In-First-Out" buffer. It gets faster the longer it runs.
- **Recording:** Open your phone's **Screen Recorder**. Select **"Media Sounds"** to capture the AI Voice + Soundtrack.

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I clicked start and nothing happened."
- **Status Check:** Look at the top right `SYSTEM:` indicator. Does it change to `WRITING...` or `RENDERING...`?
- **Network Latency:** You are connecting to the Pollinations Cloud API. If you are on weak 4G/5G, the first image may take up to 20 seconds.
- **Audio Context:** Tap the screen again anywhere. Sometimes Android requires two taps to unlock the Web Audio API synthesizer.

### "There is no sound."
- **Check the Switch:** On iPhone, the physical "Silent" switch on the side MUST be off.
- **Check the Output:** Ensure "Media Volume" is up, not just "Ringer Volume."

### "The image is static."
- The Platinum Edition uses a **"Cinematic Pan"** (Ken Burns effect) instead of choppy AI video. This allows for 4K resolution. If it isn't moving, your browser's "Low Power Mode" might be disabling CSS animations. Turn off Battery Saver.

## 🧬 ARIA DNA PROTOCOL
The character **Aria** is hardcoded. You do not need to describe her.
- **You Type:** "Running through the rain."
- **The AI Generates:** "Aria (Platinum hair, violet eyes) running through the rain."
She will appear consistent in every shot.

**Titanium & Glass. Forever Ascending.**
